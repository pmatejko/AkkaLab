1And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was noised that he was in the house.
2:2And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, no, not even about the door:
and he spake the word unto them. 2:3And they come, bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four.
2:4And when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when
they had broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay. 2:5And Jesus seeing their
faith saith unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven. 2:6But there were certain of the scribes
sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, 2:7Why doth this man thus speak? he blasphemeth: who can forgive
sins but one, even God? 2:8And straightway Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within
themselves, saith unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?

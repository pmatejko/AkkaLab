The mother of our particular hobbit — what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description
nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a

There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to
disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making
a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they
dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural
leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long
clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which
they have twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the

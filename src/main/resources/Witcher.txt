“Then they taught me various things until the day when I left Kaer Morhen and took to the
road. I’d earned my medallion, the Sign of the Wolf's School. I had two swords: silver and
iron, and my conviction, enthusiasm, incentive and… faith. Faith that I was needed in a
world full of monsters and beasts, to protect the innocent. As I left Kaer Morhen, I
dreamed of meeting my first monster. I couldn't wait to stand eye to eye with him. And the
moment arrived.
My first monster, Iola, was bald and had exceptionally rotten teeth. I came across him on
the highway where, with some fellow monsters, deserters, he'd stopped a peasant's cart and
pulled out a little girl, maybe thirteen years old. His companions held her father while
the bald man tore off her dress, yelling it was time for her to meet a real man. I rode
up and said the time had come for him, too— I thought I was very witty. The bald monster
released the girl and threw himself at me with an axe. He was slow but tough. I hit him
twice— not clean cuts, but spectacular, and only then did he fall. His gang ran away when
they saw what a witcher's sword could do to a man…."
"And do you know why? I wanted the girl, sobbing with gratitude, to kiss her savior on the
hands, and her father to thank me on his knees. In reality her father fled with his
attackers, and the girl, drenched in the bald man's blood, threw up, became hysterical and
fainted in fear when I approached her. Since then, I’ve only very rarely interfered in
such matters."
